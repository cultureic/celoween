- **Contract Address**: `0x7Ed5CC0cf0B0532b52024a0DDa8fAE24C6F66dc3`

### 3. Deployment Monitoring Scripts ✅
Created two powerful deployment automation scripts:

#### `monitor-deployment.sh`
- Real-time deployment status tracking
- Progress bar with percentage
- Color-coded status indicators
- Desktop notifications (macOS)
- Watch mode for continuous monitoring
- Verbose output option

#### `deploy-and-monitor.sh`
- Complete deployment workflow automation
- Pre-deployment checks (Node.js version, git status)
- Automatic commit and push
- Real-time deployment monitoring
- Success/failure summary

### 4. Comprehensive Documentation ✅
- **DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md**: Full deployment process documentation
- **scripts/README.md**: Detailed script usage and examples

## 🚀 How to Use the Deployment Scripts

### Quick Deploy
```bash
# Make changes, commit, push, and monitor in one command
./scripts/deploy-and-monitor.sh -m "Your commit message"
```

### With Notifications
```bash
# Get desktop notifications when deployment completes
./scripts/deploy-and-monitor.sh -m "Update feature" -n
```

### Monitor Current Deployment
```bash
# Check status of latest deployment
./scripts/monitor-deployment.sh
```

### Watch Mode
```bash
# Continuously monitor all deployments
./scripts/monitor-deployment.sh -w
```

## 🔧 Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

All set in Vercel:
- ✅ `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection with SSL
- ✅ `DIRECT_URL` - Direct PostgreSQL connection
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID` - Privy authentication
- ✅ `PRIVY_APP_SECRET` - Privy secret key
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` - WalletConnect
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_MILESTONE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_ALFAJORES` - Smart contract
- ✅ `ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS` - Admin access control
- ✅ `DATABASE_SSL_CERT` - SSL certificate (base64)

---

## 📊 Deployment Status

### Current Production URL
Check `vercel ls` for the latest production deployment URL.

### Deployment History
```bash
# View all deployments
vercel ls

# View logs for specific deployment
vercel logs <deployment-url>
```

## 🐛 Fixed Issues

### 1. Contract Address Validation Error
**Error**: 
```
Address "0x7Ed5CC0cf0B0532b52024a0DDa8fAE24C6F66dc3 " is invalid
```

**Root Cause**: Trailing space in environment variable

**Solution**:
- Cleaned up `.env.local` duplicate variables
- Added `.trim()` to contract address getter
- Added format validation (0x prefix, 42 characters)

### 2. Node.js Version Compatibility
**Issue**: Project required Node.js v20+, but v18 was active

**Solution**: 
```bash
nvm use 20.19.4
```
