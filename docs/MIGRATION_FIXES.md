### ❌ Issue 4: Admin Dashboard Not Linked

- Visible to all users (protected by wallet check on admin pages)
- Links to admin dashboard at `/admin`

**Files Changed:**
- `components/Header.tsx` - Added Admin nav link

---

## Current Navigation Structure

### Header Navigation
```
🎃 Contest  → /contests (Single active contest)
👻 Admin    → /admin (Admin dashboard - wallet protected)
👤 Profile  → /profile (User profile)
```

### Admin Dashboard
```
/admin              → Main dashboard with stats
/admin/edit         → Edit contest details & status
/admin/submissions  → View & moderate submissions
/admin/results      → Leaderboard & export CSV
```

---

## Single Contest Model

**Celoween is designed for ONE active contest at a time:**

- ✅ Users see single contest on `/contests`
- ✅ Admin manages contest via `/admin`
- ✅ Admin can edit contest details anytime
- ✅ Admin controls status: Draft → Active → Voting → Ended
- ✅ No "create new contest" feature - edit the existing one

**Workflow:**
1. Admin creates initial contest via database/API
2. Admin edits contest details at `/admin/edit`
3. Admin changes status as contest progresses
4. When contest ends, admin can reuse same contest by changing dates

---

- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL
- Tables: Contest, Submission, Vote, Reward, User
